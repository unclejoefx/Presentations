    "\n",
    "Security is protection from, or resilience against, potential harm (or other unwanted coercion) caused by others, \n",
    "by restraining the freedom of others to act. Beneficiaries (technically referents) of security may be of persons \n",
    "and social groups, objects and institutions, ecosystems or any other entity or phenomenon vulnerable to unwanted change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personal Security is a state of being that occurs after all reasonable and adequate measures have been taken to deter or\n",
    "delay a crime or possible crime, as well as adequate provision being made to warn against such a possible crime, in order\n",
    "to protect our assets\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will help us initiate a trained AI model that will help in reducing theft such as personal belongings."

    "\n",
    "A security tracking chip is a microchip that is often built into a computer to provide hardware-based security. It can be \n",
    "added later by industrious users who attach the chip to the motherboard. Some of the data we transmit throughout the day is \n",
    "sent unencrypted, as plain text. TPM chips use a mix of software and hardware to protect any important passwords or encryption\n",
    "keys when they are sent in this unencrypted form. If a TPM chip senses that a system's integrity has been compromised by a \n",
    "virus or malware, it can start up in a quarantine mode to help fix the problem. TPM chips also provide safe storage of \n",
    "encryption keys, certificates and passwords used for logging in to online services, which is a more secure method than storing\n",
    "them inside software on the hard drive.\n",
    "If the device is also stolen, the original user can login (cloud) and automatical trigger the alarm system and the person that \n",
