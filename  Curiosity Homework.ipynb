    " ## Now, What is Generative AI (Gen AI)?\n",
    "* It is a type of AI that is able to create new content, just like humans. Examples, They can write essays, solve math problems, and can even win an art competitions just like humans. This is in no way undermining the uniqueness of our work (humans). Though Gen AI are very useful, it requires humans to direct it on what to do each time, meaning they are not agent to themselves, and therefor cannot act on their own, unless humans directs them on what to do.Interesting, huh!\n",
    "* One way we can instruct Gen AI,is by sending it a prompt, which is usually a text instructions (such as questions, request et al)\n",
    "* It is also important to note that, Gen AIs that read and write text are called Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
    "* Gen AI can be used to automate creative task that only humans have been able to do. This saves time and resources(money)."
